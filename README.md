# FoodDeliverySystem
This is a simple C++ program that simulates a food delivery management system using a stack. It allows users to:  
Add new food orders. 
Confirm and deliver orders (last-in, first-out). 
Display the list of pending orders. 

The system is ideal for small-scale food delivery operations where orders are processed sequentially.
